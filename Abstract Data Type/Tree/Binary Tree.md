# Binary Tree

* Each internal node has at least 2 children
* The children of a node are an ordered pair

#### Properties of Proper/Full Binary Tree

n -> number of nodes

e -> number of external nodes

i -> number of internal nodes
$$
e=i+1\\
n=2e-1\\
h\leq i\\
h\leq \frac{n+1}{2}\\
h \geq \log{e}\\
h \geq \log {(n+1)}-1
$$

#### Full/Proper Bianary Tree

* A tree which every node has either 0 or two children

#### Complete Binary Tree

* A binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible

#### Perfect Binary Tree

* A binary tree in which all internal nodes has two children and all leaves has the same depth or level
