# [Intersection of Two Linked Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-linked-lists/)

## Description

Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.

For example, the following two linked lists:

begin to intersect at node c1.

## Example

**Example 1:**

[![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/06/29/160_example_1_1.png)](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/06/29/160_example_1_1.png)

```
Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,6,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
Output: Reference of the node with value = 8
Input Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,6,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
```

 

**Example 2:**

[![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/06/29/160_example_2.png)](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/06/29/160_example_2.png)

```
Input: intersectVal = 2, listA = [1,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1
Output: Reference of the node with value = 2
Input Explanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as [1,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.
```

 

**Example 3:**

[![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/13/160_example_3.png)](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/13/160_example_3.png)

```
Input: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
Output: null
Input Explanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.
```

## Solution 1

```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode(int x) {
 *         val = x;
 *         next = null;
 *     }
 * }
 */
public class Solution {
    public ListNode getIntersectionNode(ListNode headA, ListNode headB) {
        if(headA==null || headB==null)
            return null;
        Set<ListNode> list = new HashSet<>();
        ListNode a = headA;
        ListNode b = headB;
        while(a != null){
            list.add(a);
            a = a.next;
        }
        while(b != null){
            if(list.contains(b))
                return b;
            b = b.next;
        }
        return null;
    }
}
```



## Solution 2

```java
public ListNode getIntersectionNode(ListNode headA, ListNode headB) {
    //boundary check
    if(headA == null || headB == null) 
      	return null;
   
    ListNode a = headA;
    ListNode b = headB;
    
    //if a & b have different len, then we will stop the loop after second iteration
    while( a != b){
    	//for the end of first iteration, we just reset the pointer to the head of another linkedlist
        a = a == null? headB : a.next;
        b = b == null? headA : b.next;    
    }
    return a;
}
```
