# [Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/)

Say you have an array `prices` for which the *i*th element is the price of a given stock on day *i*.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

## Solution 1

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int maxprofit = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
            if (prices[i] > prices[i - 1])
                maxprofit += prices[i] - prices[i - 1];
        }
        return maxprofit;
    }
}
```

## Solution 2

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int i = 0;
        int valley = prices[0];
        int peak = prices[0];
        int maxprofit = 0;
        while (i < prices.length - 1) {
            while (i < prices.length - 1 && prices[i] >= prices[i + 1])
                i++;
            valley = prices[i];
            while (i < prices.length - 1 && prices[i] <= prices[i + 1])
                i++;
            peak = prices[i];
            maxprofit += peak - valley;
        }
        return maxprofit;
    }
}
```
