# JavaScript

#### AJAX

Ajax stands for Asynchronous Javascript and XML. A browser build-in XMLHttpRequest object (to request data from a web server), JavaScript, and HTML DOM (to display or user data)

* Read data from a web server - after the page has loaded
* Update a web page without reloading the page
* Send data to a web server - in the background



#### Asynchronous vs. Synchronous

* Synchronous code is executed in sequence - each statement waits for the previous statement to finish before executing.
* Asynchronous code doesn't have to wait - keep the site or app responsive, reducing waiting time for the user
