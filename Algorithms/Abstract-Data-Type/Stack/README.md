# Stack

A **stack** is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two principle operators:

* push(e): adds element e to the top of stack
* pop(): removes and returns the top element from the stack, or null if it is empty

#### Auxiliary methods:

* top(): returns the top element of the stack without removing it, or null if it is empty
* size(): returns the number of elements in the stack
* isEmpty(): returns true if the stack is empty, false otherwise

#### Performance

* LIFO (last in, first out)
* The space used is O(n)
* Each operation runs in time O(1)
