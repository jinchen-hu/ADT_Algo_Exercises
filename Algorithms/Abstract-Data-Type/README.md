# Abstract Data Type (ADT)

ADT is a mathematic modal for a certain class of data structures that have same behavior (semetics).

1. They help to simplify descriptions of abstract algorithms, thereby allowing us to write simplified pseudocode with less details
2. They allow us classify and evalue data structures in regards to the common behaviors between data types
